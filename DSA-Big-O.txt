1.1 O(1)
1.2 O(n)

2.1 O(1) It only performs the one function, dividing the value by 2. There is no reason
to believe that the value is an array. 

3.1 O(n^2) There are two for loops, one is nested inside the other one. That 
means the operation is raised to a power of 2. 

4.1 O(n) There is one for loop that goes through the array sequentially, therefore
it is dependent on the array's size. 

5.1 O(n) There is one for loop.

6.1 O(n^2) There are two for loops, one is nested in the first. 

7.2 O(n) there is one for loop. 

8.1 O(log n) Because it halves (takes the average) of the provided index

9.1 O(1) It is performing just the one operation, and not interating through the
array. 

10.1 O(n) there is only one for loop
